## Phase 2 — Simulation Engine

### Goal

Enable what-if simulations using attributes, remaps, and accelerators.

### Simulation Profiles

Profiles are ephemeral and include:

- Base attributes
- Implants
- Remaps
- Accelerators

Types:

- Character-based
- Theoretical

### Training Timeline

Training is modeled as a timeline of segments:

- Attributes are constant per segment
- Boundaries occur at remaps or accelerator changes

### Attribute Calculation

- Correct EVE formulas
- Additive modifiers
- No stacking accelerators

### Remap Simulation

- 1–3 remaps
- Cooldowns enforced
- Bonus remaps supported
- Manual placement

### Accelerator Simulation

- Temporary attribute modifiers
- Fixed duration
- One active at a time

Success Criteria:

- Deterministic simulation
- Explainable timelines
- No persistence or mutation
